# fvcom441
The repo has the base version directly downloaded from "http://code.fvcom.org/medm/fvcom441.git" which is the most updated version up to date. I aim to add a general version of passive dye/tracer module which can be applied not only to point source. The complilation and run environment is ada.uea.ac.uk. The first a few applications will be Liverpool Bay and West Sri Lanka coastal ocean.
